## Latest run: 2026-10-03, /feature retro edits and the add-dsa-entry ordering rule

Run by: self
Trigger: run 1's retro edits to `.claude/skills/feature/SKILL.md` (Stage 2's test-writer instruction and re-run trigger; the test re-run path runs Stage 3's gate before spawning an implementer), plus PR #53's edit to `add-dsa-entry`'s body (a later-kind prerequisite fails the pinned list; ask the user).
Scope: no description or routing rule changed, only skill bodies, so this covers the scenarios whose Expected answer depends on `/feature` or `add-dsa-entry`: SR-01, SR-05 (its triage-first rule is `/feature`'s Stage 0), SR-07, SR-17 and SR-18. Before running, SR-17's prompt was refreshed. Its first half asked for a sticky Contents list, which PR #52 built as the "On this page" nav, so it now asks to highlight the current section in that list while scrolling (still unbuilt). Its Expected answer is unchanged.

| ID    | Routing decision      | Reasoning (1 line)                                                                                        | Grade |
| ----- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| SR-01 | `/feature`            | New search-dialog UI behavior needing a design choice, tests and UI review.                               | PASS  |
| SR-05 | Triage first (direct) | A bug of unknown size: reproduce and find the cause per `/feature` Stage 0, then route by what was found. | PASS  |
| SR-07 | `/feature`            | Computed metadata plus UI on cards and topic pages; content skills send app-code changes to `/feature`.   | PASS  |
| SR-17 | `/feature`            | Page UI plus a new diagram-check rule; `add-case-study` sends page and tooling changes to `/feature`.     | PASS  |
| SR-18 | `add-dsa-entry`       | A new entry with tested code; checked that no LRU cache entry exists yet.                                 | PASS  |

Notes: every agent applied the intended rule, and none was a near-miss. SR-18's agent checked that the named entry still doesn't exist, as the previous run's note asks.
